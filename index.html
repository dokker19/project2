                         Turns out, In the original data set of 160+ countries, the United States is 46th out of the 162 countries, meaning it is in the bottom 28th percent in terms of income equality.
                         Notable countries with higher GDP including Japan, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, UK, Germany, all have significantly lower GINI index. 
                         In fact, most of the countries with worse GINI indices are low-GDP African countries without proper economic structure nor education system.

                        Before getting into further details about why the wealth, we can look at how the wealth gap in the United States has changed over time. 
                        Going all the way back to the 1960s, we can see that gaps between household incomes were lower. 
                        However, as the country grew and became more developed over the years, we can see a sharp increase in only the top 10% of earners. 
                        While there’s a clear upward trend for the top 20% of households in the US, the lowest 10% has remained nearly static.
                        <br><br>
                        What does that mean? We have skyrocketing wealth within the country, but in reality it’s only going to the people at the top. 
                        While an increase in wealth is expected within a country over time, and individuals do become more wealthy, we want to also understand why only the rich people are becoming even richer and the poor remain poor.

                        Delving into the intricacies of wealth inequality unveils a crucial dimension often overlooked—the gendered aspect. Throughout history, women have consistently faced lower pay, and, in some instances, no compensation for their labor. Recognizing and addressing this gender-based wealth disparity is essential for dismantling systemic barriers and fostering a fairer economic landscape.
                        <br><br>
                        The wage gap, often referred to as the disparity in earnings between men and women, remains a significant social and economic issue with far-reaching implications. 
                        This gap is a manifestation of gender-based discrimination and systemic inequalities that persist in workplaces worldwide. 
                        Historically, women have earned less than their male counterparts for similar work, perpetuating economic imbalances and hindering societal progress. 
                        According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020, women earned approximately 82 cents for every dollar earned by men.  
                        While this represents an improvement from previous years, the gap remains a significant challenge. The graph above depicts the income of male and women accoring to the U.S. Census Bureau from the 1960s to the 2020s. 
                        We can see how it starts out quite large, but as it gets closer to today it begins closing, though the gap is still significant.
                        <br><br>
                        However, it is crucial to recognize that these statistics don't even encompass the entirety of the problem, as they often exclude unpaid domestic labor.  
                        Ultimately, addressing the wage gap is essential for promoting gender equality, fostering diversity and inclusion, and maximizing the full potential of our workforce and makes sure to value the contributions of all individuals equally.

                        The wage gap is not a one-size-fits-all issue; its intricacies deepen when considering the intersectionality of gender and race. 
                        The disparities become glaringly pronounced when analyzing data that highlights the earnings of women of color compared to their white counterparts.
                        The Graph above shows how much money different races and genders make compared to every dollar a white man makes.
                        <br><br>
                        The findings of a study conducted by the National Women's Law Center in 2020 underscore the severity of the issue. Black women earned only 63 cents, Native American women 60 cents, and Latina women 55 cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men. 
                        These stark discrepancies illuminate the compounded challenges faced by women of color, who navigate a complex landscape of both gender and racial biases. 
                        Moreover, it's crucial to recognize that men of color also experience the intersectionality of gender and race in the context of the wage gap.
                        While the disparities may manifest differently, they are nonetheless significant. 
                        Men of color encounter their own set of challenges, navigating a landscape where both racial and gender biases intersect, impacting their earning potential and career trajectories. 
                        <br><br>
                        This highlights the need for an inclusive approach that addresses the diverse experiences within the workforce, aiming to dismantle barriers for everyone affected by the multifaceted nature of the wage gap.
                        Recognizing and addressing these intersecting factors is crucial for creating effective policies and initiatives that promote equality for all. 
                        By acknowledging the multifaceted nature of the wage gap, we can work towards dismantling the barriers that disproportionately affect certain groups, fostering a more inclusive and equitable workforce.
