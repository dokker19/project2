                        Our mission is to educate and illuminate the intricacies of wealth inequality, providing insights and data-driven analysis to foster a deeper understanding of the complex factors at play. 
                        As economic globalization continues to intertwine nations and societies, the consequences of uneven wealth distribution extend far beyond individual financial circumstances, influencing access to education, healthcare, and opportunities for countless individuals.

                        The GINI coefficient is a measure of income or wealth distribution across a population, 
                        used to gauge economic inequality. Values range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing perfect equality
                        (where everyone has the same income) and 100 representing perfect inequality (where all income 
                        is held by a single person). This map visualizes the GINI coefficient for countries around the world,

                        The United States, with a GINI index of 41.5, is at the bottom. And lower the GINI index, the lesser the inequality.
                         Does that mean income inequality is not a problem in the states?
                         The illustration below will give a big picture viewâ€¦
                         <br><br>
                         Here, the United States is actually at the top by a great margin. 
                         Turns out, In the original data set of 160+ countries, the United States is 46th out of the 162 countries, meaning it is in the bottom 28th percent in terms of income equality.
                         Notable countries with higher GDP including Japan, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, UK, Germany, all have significantly lower GINI index. 
                         In fact, most of the countries with worse GINI indices are low-GDP African countries without proper economic structure nor education system. 
                         <br><br>
                         For a country with the highest GDP in the world, United States actually seem to have some SERIOUS income inequality issues, below we will take a closer look into them.

                        Before getting into further details about why the wealth, we can look at how the wealth gap in the United States has changed over time. 
                        Going all the way back to the 1960s, we can see that gaps between household incomes were lower. 
                        However, as the country grew and became more developed over the years, we can see a sharp increase in only the top 10% of earners. 
                        While thereâ€™s a clear upward trend for the top 20% of households in the US, the lowest 10% has remained nearly static.
                        <br><br>
                        What does that mean? We have skyrocketing wealth within the country, but in reality itâ€™s only going to the people at the top. 
                        While an increase in wealth is expected within a country over time, and individuals do become more wealthy, we want to also understand why only the rich people are becoming even richer and the poor remain poor.

                        Delving into the intricacies of wealth inequality unveils a crucial dimension often overlookedâ€”the gendered aspect. Throughout history, women have consistently faced lower pay, and, in some instances, no compensation for their labor. Recognizing and addressing this gender-based wealth disparity is essential for dismantling systemic barriers and fostering a fairer economic landscape.
                        <br><br>
                        The wage gap, often referred to as the disparity in earnings between men and women, remains a significant social and economic issue with far-reaching implications. 
                        This gap is a manifestation of gender-based discrimination and systemic inequalities that persist in workplaces worldwide. 
                        Historically, women have earned less than their male counterparts for similar work, perpetuating economic imbalances and hindering societal progress. 
                        According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020, women earned approximately 82 cents for every dollar earned by men.  
                        While this represents an improvement from previous years, the gap remains a significant challenge. The graph above depicts the income of male and women accoring to the U.S. Census Bureau from the 1960s to the 2020s. 
                        We can see how it starts out quite large, but as it gets closer to today it begins closing, though the gap is still significant.
                        <br><br>
                        However, it is crucial to recognize that these statistics don't even encompass the entirety of the problem, as they often exclude unpaid domestic labor.  
                        Ultimately, addressing the wage gap is essential for promoting gender equality, fostering diversity and inclusion, and maximizing the full potential of our workforce and makes sure to value the contributions of all individuals equally.

                        The wage gap becomes even more complex and nuanced when considering the intersectionality of gender and race. 
                        Data reveals that women of color experience an even wider pay gap compared to their white counterparts. 
                        <br><br>
                        According to a study by the National Women's Law Center, in 2020, Black women earned only 63 cents, Native American women 60 cents, and Latina women 55 cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men. 
                        This intersectional perspective underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing pay disparities. 
                        omen of color often face compounded challenges related to both gender and racial biases, leading to systemic barriers in career advancement and fair compensation. 
                        <br><br>
                        Recognizing and addressing these intersecting factors is crucial for creating effective policies and initiatives that promote equality for all. 
                        By acknowledging the multifaceted nature of the wage gap, we can work towards dismantling the barriers that disproportionately affect certain groups, fostering a more inclusive and equitable workforce.
